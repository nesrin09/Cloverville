  "paragraphs": [
    "Cloverville is an organic village where 42 people live green, grow their own vegetables and share everything from egg cartons to avocado trees. The village is bursting with green initiatives, with residents cycling, composting and brewing nettle tea like never before.",
    "These initiatives are expressed through both green individual actions, such as cycling, eating vegan or switching to energy-efficient lighting, common tasks, such as preparing food for communal meals, cleaning up the workshop, taking care of shared outdoor areas and various garden opportunities, and exchange tasks where residents can exchange resources and services.",
    "Cloverville wants to show that it is possible to live more sustainably, both alone and together, and hopes to inspire other communities to do the same."
